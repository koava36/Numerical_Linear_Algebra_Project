# Numerical_Linear_Algebra_Project
Project on Skoltech course 'Numerical Linear Algebra'. 

Study of the paper 'What if Neural Networks had SVDs?' by Alexander Mathiasen et al.

FastH method applied to Spec-RNN ('Stabilizing Gradients for Deep Neural Networks via Efficient SVD
Parameterization', Jiong Zhang,  Qi Lei and Inderjit S. Dhillon?):
